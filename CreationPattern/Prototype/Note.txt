Prototype pattern allows to create a new object by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
It is used when create a new object is time-consuming or expensive, and when the new object is similar to an existing one.

Advantages:
* Provides a way to create new objects without knowing the details of how they are created.
* Allows for the creation of complex objects by copying existing ones.
* Can clone objects with different configurations, making it flexible and reusable.

Disadvantages:
* Using shallow copy can lead to issues if the object contains references to mutable objects.
* Can be complex to implement if the object has many dependencies or requires deep copying.
