Abstract Factory is built base on Factory Method pattern, this pattern will create sub-factories which are the sub-classes that implement the highest-level factory actions

This pattern provides an interface or abstract class for the initialization of the objects which have the same characteristics

Advantages:
* Can ensure that the object created from the factory will be compatible together
* Follow Single responsiblity principle
* Follow Open\Close principle

Disadvantages:
* Complexly code because there are many interfaces and abstract classes are initialized at the same time
