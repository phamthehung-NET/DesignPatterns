The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows for the sharing of objects to support a large number of similar objects efficiently.
It is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that have similar characteristics, allowing for memory savings and performance improvements.

Advantages:
* Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of objects.
* Improves performance by reducing the number of objects created.
* Allows for the creation of a large number of similar objects without significant overhead.

Disadvantages:
* Increases complexity by requiring a factory to manage the shared objects.
* Can lead to difficulties in managing state, especially if objects have both shared and unshared state.
* May require additional effort to implement and maintain the factory and shared objects.
