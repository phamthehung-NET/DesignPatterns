Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use, hiding its complexities from the client code.
The Facade pattern is used to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use and understand.

Advantages:
* Simplifies the interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.
* Reduces dependencies on the subsystem, allowing for easier maintenance and changes.
* Provides a single point of access to the subsystem, making it easier to manage and use.
* Can help to decouple the client code from the subsystem, allowing for more flexibility in the design.

Disadvantages:
* Can lead to a loss of flexibility, as the facade may not expose all the functionality of the subsystem.
* May hide important details of the subsystem, making it harder to understand how it works.
* Can create a single point of failure, as the facade becomes a critical part of the system.
