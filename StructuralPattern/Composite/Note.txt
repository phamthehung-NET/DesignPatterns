Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
It allows clients to treat individual objects (leaf) and groups of objects (composite) uniformly, via a common interface.

Advantages:
* Simplifies client code. The client can treat individual objects and compositions uniformly, which simplifies the code that uses them.
* Makes it easier to add new kinds of components. You can add new leaf or composite classes without changing existing code.
* Supports recursive structures. The pattern allows you to create complex tree structures that can be traversed recursively.

Disadvantages:
* Can make the design more complex. The pattern introduces additional classes and interfaces, which can make the design more complex.
* May lead to performance issues. If the tree structure becomes too deep or too wide, it can lead to performance issues when traversing or manipulating the structure.
